# Fitness Center Tracker
I like to go to my university's fitness center, but I have a problem - it's always *so darn busy.* This app aims to alleviate the congestion in the fitness center, by allowing users to see how busy the gym currently is, and how busy it will possibly be when they're planning to go.

# How It Works

# Technologies
* **Jamstack** - Javascript, API, markdown. 
* **Serverless** - static files are hosted on a web server and serverless backend written in go is using Digital Ocean "functions" serverless technology.
* **Progressive web app** - users are meant to visit the website once, and download the progressive web app to their phones.
